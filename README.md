## Rules of the Game

1. The cave system is represented as a grid of rooms, and you will start at a random location.

2. Each room can contain hazards like the Wumpus or a bottomless pit.

3. You will be notified if a hazard is nearby.

4. To win the game, find the treasure and return to your starting location.

5. Be careful! Walking into a room with the Wumpus or falling into a pit will end the game.

6. The game will continue until you either win, lose, or decide to quit.
